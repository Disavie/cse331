This test helps checking if your hybrid merge sort is implemented properly to make sure your code time complexity is correct

test_hybrid_merge_actually_hybrid: 0/0

This test is similar to test_hybrid_merge_sort_speed, but it checks if your hybrid merge sort function is a true hybrid merge sort or not.

NOTE: one way to fail this test is if hybrid_merge_sort doesn't call itself recursively (e.g. if you have a separate merge_sort helper function). In this case, you must take extra care and ensure that your overall algorithm is actually hybrid to avoid losing points.
